    <h3>With the 2016 Olympics right around the corner I decided to do my tribute page on accomplishments of the world's fastest man, Usain Bolt! </h3>

    <h4 class="text-left">Biography: </h4>
    <p>Born as Usain St. Leo Bolt on August 21, 1986. He became famous as the world's fastest man in 2008, the year he ran the 100 meters in a spectacular 9.69 seconds at the Beijing Olympic Games. Born in Jamaica, Usain Bolt was a speedster from the start:
      he was only 15 when he won a gold medal in the 200 meters at the 2002 World Junior Championships. He turned pro in 2004 and ran in the Olympics that year, but injuries and a genetic curvature of his spine delayed his development. In 2008, healthy
      and grown to a height of 6'5" tall, he exploded onto the scene by breaking the world record for the 100 meters with a run of 9.72 seconds in New York City on May 31st. At the Summer Olympics three months later, Bolt won three gold medals in the
      100 meters (9.69 seconds), 200 meters (19.30 seconds), and 4x100 meter relay (37.10 seconds), all world-record times. Bolt gained almost as much fame for how he finished the 100 meters: easing up to raise his arms and pound his chest in celebration
      even before he crossed the finish line. The next year, in Berlin, he ran the 100 meters in a stunning 9.58 for a new record, more than a tenth of a second faster than anyone else had ever run the race. In 2012 he again won Olympic gold in the 100
      meters (with a time of 9.63 seconds) and in the 200 meters (with a time of 19.32 seconds)
